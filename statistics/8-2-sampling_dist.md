[Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2009.html#toc77) (scoring)

>>  With sample size of n=10, we find that standard error is about .763 while the confidence interval is (1.267, 3.538) at 1000 iterations. As we run this experiment with larger sample sizes, we find that standard error tends to decrease while the confidence interval decreases in width to a more narrow range. For example, at n = 100: SE is reduced to 0.21 and CI to (1.7, 2.4).
