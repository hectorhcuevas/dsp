>> We know that this data is skewed when we examine and compare the mean to the median. Mean(sample) yields 74,278.7 while Median(sample) is 51,226. The sample skewness is 1.055 and the pearson median skewness is .264. This confirms that the distribution is skewed right. Finally, cdf.Prob(Mean(sample)) tells us that about 66% of the population makes less than the mean.
