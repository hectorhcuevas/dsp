[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> **Are  first babies are lighter or heavier than others?** 
>>In the given data first babies were found to be slightly lighter than others, although the results are not statistically significant to draw conclusions. The difference in means is .125, which means _firsts_ babies were found to be that much lighter than our _others_. The cohen effect size was .089, which gives us our difference in means in terms of standard deviations.
