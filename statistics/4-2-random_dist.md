[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The pmf and cdf graphs plotted indicate that the numbers are indeed random. The pmf plot indicated that our random variate have an equal probability mass function. This is why the plot simply shows a thousand vertical lines with equal y(pmf) values. As for the cdf plot, it depicts almost a completely straight line. What this figure shows is that 10% of the sample is below
the random variate value of .1, 20% is below the .2 value, and so on exactly as we should expect.
