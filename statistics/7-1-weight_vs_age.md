[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> The scatterplot and correlations show a generally weak relationship between the two variables. Pearson's is about .07 while Spearman's is about .09. Additionally, we can use an example provided in the chapter and bin the data by age and plot the percentiles of weight for each respective bin. This supports our conclusions of a non-linear relationship; while between the ages of 15 to 25 the birth weight tends to rise more quickly, the effect is weaker after that.
